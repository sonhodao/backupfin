# üöÄ Laravel Deployer

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/lorisleiva/laravel-deployer/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lorisleiva/laravel-deployer/actions)

Laravel Deployer is a lightweight wrapper of [Deployer.org](https://github.com/deployphp/deployer) giving Artisan the power of zero-downtime deployment.

## ‚ú® Features
* **Simple** setup process
* **Zero downtime** deployments
* Ready-to-use tasks for Laravel
* Choose your **deployment strategy**
* Agentless, it's just SSH
* Something went wrong? **Rollback** to the previous release

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Installation

```bash
composer require lorisleiva/laravel-deployer
```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Configuration
In order to generate your deployment configuration file, simply run:

```bash
php artisan deploy:init
```

* It will ask you a few questions to help you get started and generate a `config/deploy.php` file.
* Read more about the available options, tasks, strategies; about how to customize your hosts, your deployment flow and much more in the [documentation](docs/README.md).

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment
When you‚Äôre ready to deploy, run:

```bash
php artisan deploy
```

* If anything goes wrong during the deployment flow, the release will be discarded just like nothing happened.
* Because we are using zero-downtime deployments, make sure your server‚Äôs root path points to the `{{deploy_path}}/current` symlink.
* If your project has already been deployed, before using Laravel Deployer, you might be interested in this [first deployment strategy](docs/strategy-first-deploy.md).
